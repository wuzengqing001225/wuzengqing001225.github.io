## News

- **[Oct. 2025]** Gave an oral presentation at [7th Joint Korea-Japan Workshop on Management of Data](https://joohyung00.github.io/kjmd2025/) (KJMD 2025) @ Busan, South Korea.
- **[Oct. 2025]** Presented a poster online at the 2025 Michigan AI Symposium.
- **[Aug. 2025]** [The Hidden Strength of Disagreement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16565): We discovered that implicit consensus mechanisms can outperform explicit coordination in dynamic environments requiring long-horizon adaptability, where preserving agent diversity enhances exploration and robustness. Our paper is to appear at **EMNLP 2025 (Main)** @ Suzhou, China. [[Code]](https://github.com/wuzengqing001225/ConsensusDiversityTradeoffMAS)
- **[Jun. 2025]** We argue that LLM-based social simulations need clear boundaries to meaningfully contribute to social science research in our [position paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19806).
- **[Mar. 2025]** Reached the milestone of 100 citations :)
- **[Dec. 2024]** Presented a poster at the 2024 Australasian Database Conference (ADC 2024) @ Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan.
- **[Sep. 2024]** [Shall We Team Up](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12327): Following the SABM framework, we discovered the spontaneous cooperation of LLM agents in competing environments. Our paper is to appear at **EMNLP 2024 (Findings)** @ Miami, USA. [[Code]](https://github.com/wuzengqing001225/SABM_ShallWeTeamUp)
- **[Sep. 2024]** [LLMob](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14744): As a joint work with the University of Tokyo, we developed an LLM agent framework for the generation of personal activity trajectories. This work will appear at **NeurIPS 2024**. [[Code]](https://github.com/Wangjw6/LLMob/)
- **[Jul. 2024]** Presented a poster online at the ICML 2024 Workshop Agentic Markets (AMW @ ICML 2024).
- **[Jun. 2024]** Presented a poster at the Eighth International Workshop on Symbolic-Neural Learning (SNL 2024) @ National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation (Miraikan), Tokyo, Japan.
- **[Jan. 2024]** Our [paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OHINx0XsqTKS-rHOJCTqdY8Cz664Beez/view), which investigates the application of Shannon entropy in assessing students' abstraction levels to optimize students' learning process, has been accepted in the **IEEE Transactions on Education (ToE)**.
- **[Nov. 2023]** [SABM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06330): We developed a computer simulation framework that incorporates LLMs into agent-based modeling.
